Story 2.10 is complete. I implemented a comprehensive IDE integration system:

**What was implemented:**

1. **editio-lsp crate** (~900 lines) with full Language Server Protocol support:
   - Document synchronization (open, change, close)
   - Diagnostics for unresolved cross-references
   - Hover information showing label details
   - Go to definition for cross-references
   - Find all references
   - Document symbols listing
   - Completions for cross-reference labels

2. **VSCode extension** (editors/vscode/):
   - TextMate grammar for syntax highlighting (YAML front matter, block directives, math, cross-references, citations)
   - Language configuration (bracket matching, auto-closing)
   - LSP client integration
   - Commands: compile, preview, watch, stopWatch

3. **CLI commands**:
   - `editio lsp` - Starts the LSP server for IDE integration
   - `editio watch <file> -o <output>` - Watches files and auto-recompiles on changes

**Test Results:** 456 tests pass (7 new in editio-lsp)

**Note:** The repository doesn't have a remote configured, so the push command couldn't complete. The commit is available locally.
