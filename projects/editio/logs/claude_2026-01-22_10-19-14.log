## Summary

Story 1.6 "Build academic extensions for theorems, algorithms, and code listings" is complete.

### What was implemented:

1. **Block directive parsing** in editio-parser:
   - Syntax: `::: theorem {#thm:main caption="Title"} ... :::`
   - Supported types: theorem, lemma, proposition, corollary, definition, example, remark, proof, algorithm
   - Preprocessor scans input before pulldown-cmark parsing
   - Nested markdown content is supported

2. **Auto-numbering** in PDF renderer:
   - Theorems render as "Theorem 1.", "Definition 2.", etc.
   - Algorithms render as "Algorithm 1: Caption"
   - Code listings render as "Listing 1: Caption"
   - Numbering comes from the cross-reference system

3. **12 new tests** covering:
   - Parsing theorem/definition/algorithm/proof blocks
   - Parsing multiple theorem kinds
   - Nested content in block directives
   - Rendering with cross-reference data

### Test Results:
- 99 total workspace tests pass
- 27 parser tests, 22 PDF tests, 18 core tests, 17 layout tests

### Files Modified:
- `crates/editio-parser/src/lib.rs` (+327 lines)
- `crates/editio-pdf/src/lib.rs` (+267 lines)
- `AGENTS.md` (block directive patterns)
