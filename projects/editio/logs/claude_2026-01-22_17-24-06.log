## Story 3.4 Complete: Build plugin ecosystem infrastructure

I implemented comprehensive plugin ecosystem infrastructure in `editio-plugin-manager`:

**New Modules Created:**
1. **registry.rs** (~650 lines) - Central plugin registry with caching, search, and update checking
2. **marketplace.rs** (~700 lines) - Install, update, remove, publish plugins with dependency resolution
3. **verification.rs** (~750 lines) - Signature verification, checksum validation, security auditing
4. **sdk.rs** (~600 lines) - Project scaffolding with templates for plugin developers
5. **debug.rs** (~650 lines) - Hot reloading, debug logging, state inspection, performance profiling

**Test Results:**
- 49 new tests added to plugin-manager
- 696 total workspace tests pass (was 646)
- All workspace crates compile successfully

**Commit:** `d1f546f` - feat: [3.4] - Build plugin ecosystem infrastructure

Note: Repository has no remote configured, so push was not possible. Commit is saved locally.
