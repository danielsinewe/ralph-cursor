## Story 1.5 Complete

I've successfully implemented the **unified cross-reference system** for Editio. Here's what was accomplished:

### Implementation Summary

1. **CrossRefResolver** (`editio-core/src/crossref.rs`) - 500 lines
   - Tracks labels with automatic sequential numbering per element type
   - Supports label prefixes: `fig:`, `tbl:`, `eq:`, `thm:`, `alg:`, `sec:`, `lst:`
   - Hierarchical numbering support (Figure 2.1 style)
   - Validates undefined/duplicate labels

2. **Reference Syntax Extraction**
   - Simple format: `[@fig:example]` → "Figure 1"
   - Prefix format: `[See @fig:example]` → "See Figure 1"
   - Extracted from Text nodes after parsing

3. **Compilation Pipeline Integration**
   - `process_cross_references()` extracts refs and collects labels
   - `CrossRefData` passed to PDF renderer for resolution
   - Warnings for unresolved references (non-blocking)

4. **PDF Renderer Support**
   - `extract_text_with_crossrefs()` resolves references during rendering
   - All element types (paragraphs, lists, tables, theorems) support cross-refs

### Test Results
- **87 tests pass** (18 new for cross-references)
- All workspace crates compile successfully

### Commits Made
1. `feat: [1.5] - Implement unified cross-reference system`
2. `docs: add cross-reference patterns to AGENTS.md`

### Note
Repository has no remote configured, so changes could not be pushed.
