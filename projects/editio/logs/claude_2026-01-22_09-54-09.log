**Summary of Story 1.3 Implementation:**

I implemented a complete two-pass layout engine with CSS-style float algorithm in `editio-layout`:

**Pass 1 - Float Collection:**
- Scans document for images with `float=left` or `float=right` attributes
- Calculates float dimensions using dimension conversion
- Creates `WrapZone` structures defining areas text must flow around

**Pass 2 - Element Positioning:**
- Positions each element sequentially
- Calculates available width at each Y position by checking active wrap zones
- Text flows around floats with proper line-by-line width calculation
- **Lists wrap around figures** - the key differentiator! Each list item calculates its own lines with wrap zone awareness
- Page breaks triggered when content exceeds available space

**Key Types:**
- `WrapZone`: page, top, bottom, left, right, wrap_side, source_element
- `LayoutEngine`: state machine tracking current_page, current_y, content bounds
- `PositionedElement`: includes `text_lines: Vec<TextLine>` for detailed positioning
- `ElementKind`: Paragraph, Heading, CodeBlock, ListItem, Table, Image, Math, etc.

**Tests:** 17 new tests including `test_list_wraps_around_float` (key differentiator test). All 60 workspace tests pass.
