## Verification Complete

I have successfully verified and updated both the `prd.json` and `requirements.md` files to comprehensively cover all requirements from the original PRD. Here's a summary of the additions made:

### Added to prd.json (8 new user stories):
- **2.7**: Advanced academic extensions (Phase 2) - complex tables, custom list numbering, landscape pages, etc.
- **2.8**: Performance optimization - parallelization, caching, incremental compilation
- **2.9**: Extended template library - journal-specific templates (Pediatrics, JBC, JCI, Nature)
- **2.10**: IDE integration - VSCode plugin, Language Server, live preview
- **2.11**: Import/export functionality - Pandoc/LaTeX/Word/Typst conversion
- **2.12**: Advanced document features - ToC, list of figures/tables, index generation
- **3.1**: Native math renderer - replace pdflatex with Rust implementation
- **3.2**: Comprehensive error handling - all edge cases from PRD Section 9
- **3.3**: Testing and QA - regression tests, visual testing, performance benchmarks
- **3.4**: Plugin ecosystem - registry, marketplace, development tools

### Added to requirements.md:
- **Error Handling section** - Complete coverage of all edge cases from PRD Section 9
- **Implementation Phases** - Success criteria for all three phases
- **Testing Requirements** - Unit, integration, performance, and visual regression testing
- **Quality Assurance** - Code quality and user experience standards
- **Enhanced technical details** - Performance targets, memory efficiency, security model

The updated files now provide complete coverage of:
✅ All MVP features and Phase 1 requirements  
✅ All Phase 2 enhancements  
✅ All Phase 3 polish features  
✅ Complete error handling scenarios  
✅ Performance optimization requirements  
✅ Testing and quality assurance specifications  
✅ Plugin ecosystem infrastructure  

Both files now accurately reflect the full scope and complexity of the Editio project as outlined in the original PRD.
