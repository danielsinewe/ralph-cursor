Story 1.9 is complete. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:

## Story 1.9: Implement figure support with automatic text wrapping

### Changes Made:
1. **Parser (editio-parser)**: 
   - Added `Container::Image` for tracking images during parsing
   - Created `preprocess_image_attributes()` to handle inline `{...}` attributes
   - Single-image paragraphs now convert to block-level `Node::Image`

2. **PDF Renderer (editio-pdf)**:
   - Updated `render_image()` to display "Figure N: Caption" format
   - Figure numbers come from cross-reference system via `CrossRefData`
   - Bold font for figure captions with labels

3. **Integration**:
   - Figure labels with `fig:` prefix integrate with `CrossRefResolver`
   - Text wrapping around floating figures works via layout engine

### Figure Syntax Supported:
```markdown
![alt](image.png){#fig:label caption="Description" float=right width=50%}
```

### Tests:
- 15 new tests added
- 158 total workspace tests pass
