## Summary

I've completed **Story 2.1: Add LaTeX output format support**.

### What was implemented:
1. **Full LaTeX renderer** in `editio-latex` crate (~850 lines)
   - All AST node types: paragraphs, headings, code, lists, tables, figures, math, theorems, algorithms
   - Proper special character escaping
   - Auto-generated preamble with required packages
   - Cross-reference support via `\label`/`\ref`
   - Citation support via `\cite`

2. **Fixed inline text processing** in `editio-core`
   - Join adjacent Text nodes before extraction (pulldown-cmark splits at brackets)
   - Added inline math `$...$` extraction during text processing

3. **Updated AGENTS.md** with LaTeX renderer patterns

### Test results:
- **253 total tests passing** (22 new in editio-latex, 11 new in editio-core)
- All workspace crates compile successfully

### Commit:
- `feat: [2.1] - Add LaTeX output format support`
- Committed locally (no remote configured to push)
