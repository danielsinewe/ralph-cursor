**Story 1.14: Create comprehensive testing suite** is complete.

## Summary

### What was implemented:
1. **Test corpus** in `tests/fixtures/`:
   - `basic_article.md` - Full-featured academic article
   - `math_heavy.md` - Math-intensive document  
   - `minimal.md` - Simple document for quick testing
   - `references.bib` - BibTeX bibliography

2. **Integration tests** for end-to-end compilation of all document types

3. **Golden file testing** for PDF output:
   - Size-based consistency checks
   - Structure verification (PDF headers, objects, EOF)

4. **Performance benchmarks**:
   - Minimal document: <500ms ✓
   - Basic article: <1 second ✓
   - Large document (50 sections): <2 seconds ✓

5. **Edge case tests** for empty docs, unicode, nested lists, many cross-references

### Test count: 200 → 223 tests (23 new tests added)
