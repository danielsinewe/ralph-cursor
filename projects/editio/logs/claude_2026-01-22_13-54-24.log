Story 2.4 is complete. I successfully implemented document chaining for multi-file projects.

## Summary

**Story 2.4: Implement document chaining for multi-file projects**

### Changes Made:
1. **editio-core**: Added `compile_files()`, `merge_documents()`, `compile_multi()`, and `compile_files_with_bib()` functions for multi-file compilation
2. **CLI**: Updated to detect and handle multiple input files
3. **Tests**: Added 14 new integration tests covering multi-file compilation scenarios
4. **Documentation**: Updated AGENTS.md with document chaining patterns

### Key Features:
- Multiple markdown files can be compiled into a single output
- Files processed in order, content combined sequentially
- Cross-references resolve globally across all files
- Global sequential numbering (Figure 1 in file1, Figure 2 in file2)
- Metadata merging with override semantics (later files can override)
- Keywords combined from all files

### Test Results:
- 341 tests pass (14 new tests added)
- All output formats supported (PDF, HTML, LaTeX, Word)

### Usage:
```bash
editio compile chapter1.md chapter2.md chapter3.md -o book.pdf
```

Note: No remote repository is configured, so the changes could not be pushed. The commit is available locally on branch `ralph/editio`.
