Supports: Greek letters, operators, relations, fractions, roots, superscripts/subscripts, large operators (sum, int, prod), delimiters (left/right), accents, matrices (pmatrix, bmatrix, vmatrix, etc.), aligned equations, cases environments. MathRenderer now uses native rendering instead of pdflatex subprocess. 52 unit tests for math crate. 557 total workspace tests pass."
